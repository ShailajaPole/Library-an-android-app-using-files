# Library-an-android-app-using-files
Create an android application for a library with the following specifications. The library has only one copy of each book. The user should enter his/her name and select a book from pull down menu populated with the books xml file. Once the user selects the book and clicks the "issue" button, the system should check the book status from a text file that contains transactions (issues and returns). If a book is available, add new transaction to the file with the username, book title and status "issued". If the book is already issued, show a toast that shows the user with whom the book is. If the user clicks the "return" button, add a record to the file with user, book title and "returned".
